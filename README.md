# DLA-Simulation
This is an interactive website that helps users visulaize diffusion limited aggrogation. The simulation is centralized around a middle particle(s) known as the aggrogate. Particles start at the perimeter of the scene and randomly move until a collision with the aggrogate is made. When a particle touches the aggrogate, it sticks and inherits its color. This forms a fractal like shape that resembles a snowflake.

Users can adjust particle speed, radius, color, and stick probability to see how that would affect the simulation. The number of particles that are spawned in at a time can also be changed.

Features:
1. the run button adds particles to the scene with the specified parameters given by the user.
2. the reset button clears the entire scene for a new simulation.
3. users may click and drag over the scene to draw shapes they want the particles to stick to.
